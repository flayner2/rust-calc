# Introduction

A simple, standard calculator project written in Rust as my first standalone Rust project.

# Running

Make sure you have [rust](https://rustup.rs/) installed. From the root directory, run `cargo run`. That's it! If you want to run again, without recompiling, you can do `./target/debug/calculator`, or you can make it available systemwide by putting it into your `/bin/`, `/usr/bin/` or `${HOME}/.local/bin/` folder. If you do that, than you can call it by simply typing `calculator`.
